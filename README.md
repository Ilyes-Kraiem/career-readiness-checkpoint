# Career Readiness Checkpoint :

## Where I Am Now

At this stage, I feel **ready to take the next step in my career path** with a clear understanding of my strengths, my current limits, and the areas I am actively improving.

This bootcamp helped me move from *theoretical knowledge* to a **practical, problem-solving mindset**, and gave me the confidence to approach real-world projects with structure and discipline.

I am not claiming to know everything — but I now know **how to learn, build, debug, and improve** in a professional way.
